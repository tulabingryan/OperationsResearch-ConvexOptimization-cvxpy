    "## Problem\n",
    "The 3-D printer of the MSU-IIT FabLab is used by several entities composed of the \n",
    "faculty, Ph.D. students, and industry partners. During the working hours, the operator must be \n",
    "able to operate and maintain the equipment. The director of the FabLab is confronted with the \n",
    "problem of assigning different working hours for each operator of the equipment. The operators \n",
    "are working students, hence, they are only available at specific time of the day and are paid \n",
    "by predetermined wage based on their expertise. The following data describes the operators' \n",
    "schedules and wages:\n",
    "\n",
    "         Name         Rate(PhP/hr)      Mon--Tue--Wed--Thu--Fri\n",
