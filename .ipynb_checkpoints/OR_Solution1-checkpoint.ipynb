    "## Conclusion\n",
    "It is better for DMCI to mine 0 tons of rock from the Surigao pit and 120 tons of rock from the Zamboanga pit. This would minimize the total cost to 120 units and would produce an excess of 20 tons of chats which can be sold to another contract. This decision is still cheaper compared to producing and exact number of tons as demanded from the existing contract."
